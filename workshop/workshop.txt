description=[h1]Features[/h1]
description=[list]
description=    [*] Store the selection of checkboxes in the "Client" menu.
description=    [*] Added caching of some "heavy" frequently requested data. It should have a positive effect on FPS. At the moment, caching is used only by the Server Tweaker mod itself, but in the future it is planned to switch to cache and original vanilla mechanics.
description=    [*] The utilities located in the shared directory are designed in such a way that they can be easily used in other mods. There is no need to copy pieces of code, just call the functions themselves from shared libraries.
description=    [*] Fixed some game bugs.
description=    [*] Many interface improvements that increase the convenience of the gameplay and administration.
description=    [*] Redistribution of the role model: allowing GMs and Moderators to use some features previously available only to Administrators.
description=    [*] All improvements can be turned off in the sandbox settings. Don't require a server restart, and most of them don't require a client restart either.
